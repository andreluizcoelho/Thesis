## Thesis

### I started my Doctorate in Economics at [PIMES-UFPE](https://sites.google.com/view/pimes/principal) in March 2018, and successfully defended my thesis on January 31st, 2023. After completing the necessary coursework, I dedicated approximately two years to further refining the data. This involved extensive data cleaning, considering the presence of confidential information. Consequently, I will be sharing the codes in .py format rather than .ipynb. Once my university uploads my thesis to their repository, I will provide the link to the complete thesis here.
